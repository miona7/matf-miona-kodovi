# 🎓 Miona – MATF Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of code I’ve written while studying at the **Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade**.  

It includes **exercises and assignments** completed as part of different computer science courses, as well as additional practice work I did to strengthen my understanding of programming concepts.

The goal of this repository is to keep all my university-related code organized in one place.
